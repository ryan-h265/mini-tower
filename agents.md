Reference @README.md for current development commands and tools we can use to run and test this project. Any code changes should be in the context of documentation that will change as a result of changes or new documentation required.

When discussing a new feature, create an in-depth plan and interview me in detail about literally  anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete

There's many modules and files for this project. After a big change or feature, I want to do a review and run code-simplifier on changed files.
